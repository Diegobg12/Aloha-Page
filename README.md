## DEVELOPMENT STAGES

Due the differents screen's types the project was developed using FLEX-BOX.

1. Create the DOM the page should follow.

```
<html>---<head>---<header>---<body>---<footer>
                               !
                               !
                               !
  <section>SHOP <section>ABOUT<section>SHOP <section>UPDATES
                             
                               
```
2. Create Mobile version first 600px`.

3. In most cases every section use flex box, so items adapt the sceen's size.

4. For feature part I used [Flikity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co) to create the products carrousel, download the files and follow the steps.

5. Adapt to tablet and desktop version with the follow queries
